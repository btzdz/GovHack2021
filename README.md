On August 2021, I joined the #GovHack2021 in an eight member team, composed of Data Science Immersive graduates from General Assembly, and one Software Engineer.

A bit about the hackathon:
"Govhack is Australia's largest open government and open data hackathon, attracting in excess of 1000 participants each year. It is an international competition for people of all abilities who seek to make life better through open data. Across one weekend, thousands come together to form teams, agree projects, and participate in what has become one of the worldâ€™s largest open data competition. The competition is a two-day hack event held simultaneously across Australia and New Zealand, over a 46 hour period to create concepts, mashups and models with open government data, to examine the challenges facing government and communities in new and innovative ways."

These year's challenges where focused on the following themes:
Energy and Infrastructure
Our Digital Future
Agriculture and the Environment
Health & Wellbeing

Our team focused on the NSW challenge of Getting parking right: matching car parking rates to accessibility

We created a Parking Accessibility Evaluation Tool Our solution aims to identify low and high accessibility zones that are crucial to empower land use planners with an evidence base system that meets car parking requirements, improves accessibility and mobility, and enable residents to access more opportunities. We did this by harnessing NSW open data extracting features such as such household travelling methods, Public transport, Commuter Car parks data, Population, Suburb level data, and Car Sharing data.
